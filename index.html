    <h4> WITH  OR WITHOUT YOU</h4>
    <p>  See the stone set in your eyes <br>
        See the thorn twist in your side <br>
        I'll wait for you <br>
        
        Sleight of hand and a twist of fate <br>
        On a bed of nails she makes me wait <br>
        And I'm waiting for you</p>

            <p> Yeah, we'll shine like stars in the summer night <br>
